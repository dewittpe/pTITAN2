**Abstract**

Taxa Indicator Threshold ANalysis (TITAN) was developed to identify
thresholds along environmental gradients where rapid changes in taxa
frequency and relative abundance are observed. TITAN determines separate
change-points for increasing and decreasing taxa in aggregate, as well as
change-points for individual taxa, with associated confidence intervals
generated using bootstrapping. However, if TITAN is applied to different
classes of observations, additional analyses besides using
non-overlapping confidence intervals are needed to establish whether
change-points differ between treatments or groups because non-overlapping
confidence intervals can indicate significant differences but
overlapping confidence intervals do not necessarily mean the null
hypothesis cannot be rejected. To address this, we present a new R
package, pTITAN2, which is an extension to the existing TITAN2 package.
The pTITAN2 package was developed to enable comparisons of TITAN output
between treatments by permuting the observed data between treatments
and rerunning TITAN on the permuted data. The output from pTITAN2 can be
used to perform the appropriate statistical tests and determine
statistical differences without using overlapping confidence intervals.

**Keywords:** TITAN, permutations, thresholds, community composition

# Introduction

Community ecologists are interested in understanding the structure and
interactions of multiple species in a given area or habitat type and
many are interested in understanding how communities change in response
to changing environmental or anthropogenic gradients. One method a
community ecologist can use for understanding to detect changes or
ecological thresholds across environmental gradients is Taxa Indicator
Threshold ANalysis (TITAN) [@baker2010new]. TITAN is useful for
determining the impacts of environmental or anthropogenic gradients such
as upstream impervious cover (IC) in a watershed in community ecology
studies because it both analyzes each individual taxa response and the
community as a whole in the same analysis. Additionally, unlike other
community ecology methods, TITAN separates the taxa that increase across
an environmental gradient from those that decrease to provide a more
complete picture of the community response to that gradient.

As an overview, TITAN methods use change point
[@king2003integrating;@qian2003two] and indicator species analysis
[@dufrene1997species]
to determine the point along an environmental gradient,
such as percent IC in the upstream watershed area, where individual taxa have
the largest change in occurrence frequency and abundance, and then uses
the individual taxa results to determine synchronous areas of taxa
change at the community level [@baker2010new;@baker2013titan].  Individual
taxa change points are determined by calculating the taxa's indicator
(IndVal) score along the environmental gradient and assigning the taxa
as either increasing (z+) or declining (z-) in response to an increase
in the environmental gradient variable. Permutations of data in TITAN
runs are used to calculate the likelihood of random data generating a
larger IndVal score than the observed data and to standardize the taxa
response to the environmental gradient by calculating the taxa z-scores
using permuted distributions. Taxa z-scores are added together for
increasing (z+) and declining (z-) taxa along the environmental gradient
and the point with the highest sum(z-) and sum(z+) score is defined as
the community change point. Next, bootstrapping of observed data is used
to calculate percentiles around the community and individual taxa
z-scores, and to determine if individual taxon responses are pure and
reliable. Purity is a measure of the proportion of bootstrap results
that match the taxa's observed response group as either increasing or
declining. Reliability is the proportion of bootstraps with a low
probability (p &lt; 0.01) of random data having a higher IndVal
score than the bootstrapped observed data. Community change points are
also calculated after selecting (filtering) only the taxa that exceeded
purity and reliability requirements for the increasing (fsum(z+)) and
declining (fsum(z-)) change points. Narrow peaks around the maximum
sum(z) or fsum(z) (filtered) scores indicate areas with synchronous
change in individual taxa frequency and abundance and may indicate an
ecological threshold along the environmental gradient being evaluated.
More information on TITAN methods can be found in @baker2013titan
or in the TITAN R package, TITAN2, [@R-TITAN2].

While TITAN is a powerful tool for community ecologist it requires
additional analysis for comparing results from different regions, groups
or treatments. Previously, researchers have used non-overlapping
confidence intervals for change-points from TITAN output to indicate
significant differences between groups [@king2011novel]. 2011). However,
although non-overlapping confidence intervals can indicate significant
differences, overlapping confidence intervals do not necessarily mean
the null hypothesis cannot be rejected
[@greenland2016statistical;@schenker2001judging].

We developed a new R package, pTITAN2, as an extension of the existing
TITAN2 R package [@R-TITAN2]. The goal of pTITAN2 is to enable
comparisons of TITAN output between treatments by permuting the
observed data between treatments and rerunning TITAN on the permuted
data. There are some limitations on the permutations, including (1) a
sampling site cannot occur in a category more than once, the same
limitation as in the original TITAN runs and (2) the original sample
size distribution is maintained. This addresses potential sample size
effects and enables comparisons between treatments with different sample
sizes more accurately than using non-overlapping confidence intervals. A
vignette is provided based on a dataset of macroinvertebrate data from
California streams that fall along a gradient of watershed percent
impervious cover. We compare change-points among different climate
conditions (wet, average, and dry) based on the Palmer Drought Severity
Index, which serve as the treatments in this example.

# Methods

## Operation:

Like TITAN2, pTITAN2 was developed using the R programming language
[@R-base].  pTITAN2 has been testing on Windows, Mac OS, and Ubuntu for the
latest R version (`r paste(R.version$major, R.version$minor, sep = ".")`
at time of writing) along with old release and
development versions via github actions.  Users should be familiar with the
TITAN2 package operations before using pTITAN2 (see @R-TITAN2).

The basic workflow for pTITAN2 is

1. Prepare and import the environmental gradient dataset into R
2. Prepare and import the taxonomic dataset into R
3. Pre-process raw taxonomic data to determine appropriate taxonomic level of resolution (occurrence function)
4. Select columns for the taxon level returned by occurrence function
5. Permute the data across treatment labels to generate list of lists
6. Set up cluster for parallel processing (optional)
7. Run TITAN2 series on original and permuted data sets
8. Analyze probability of exceeding observed difference in change-point between treatments based on distribution of paired change-point differences

## Implementation:

The first step of pTITAN2 is to provide the data about the environmental
gradient in exactly the format as for TITAN, step
1).  This can be either a single file or include in the taxonomic data file
[@R-TITAN2].  Like TITAN2, taxonomic information should be provided as counts or
density.  Unlike TITAN2, pTITAN2 taxonomic data needs to be provide as a code
that is 8 characters in length and captures four levels of hierarchical
taxonomic classification information.

The pTITAN2 package provides four example data sets, two taxonomic and two
environmental gradient (Table \@ref(tab:datasets)).  These data sets are
provided as raw csv files and as prepared R datasets.

```{r label = "datasets", echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
d <-
  data.table::fread(text = "
C_IC_D_06_wID|C_IC_D_06_wID.csv|Environmental Gradient|Chaparral|Dry
C_IC_N_06_wID|C_IC_N_06_wID.csv|Environmental Gradient|Chaparral|Normal
CD_06_Mall_wID|CD_06_Mall_wID.csv|Taxonomic|Chaparral|Dry
CN_06_Mall_wID|CN_06_Mall_wID.csv|Taxonomic|Chaparral|Normal
",
header = FALSE,
col.names = c("R Data", "csv File", "Data Type", "Region", "Treatment")
  )

knitr::kable(d, caption = "Example data sets provided in pTITAN2.")
```

You can gain access to the csv files via `system.file`
```{r label="list-example-data-sets"}
list.files(system.file("extdata", package = "pTITAN2"))
```
or get the data sets loaded into your environment via
```{r}
data(C_IC_D_06_wID, C_IC_N_06_wID, CD_06_Mall_wID, CN_06_Mall_wID,
     package = "pTITAN2")

str(C_IC_D_06_wID)  # Environemntal Gradient, Dry Treatment
str(C_IC_N_06_wID)  # Environemntal Gradient, Normal Treatment
dim(CD_06_Mall_wID) # Taxonomic, Dry Treatment
dim(CN_06_Mall_wID) # Taxonomic, Normal Treatment
```

The `CN_06_Mall.csv` (Chaparral Region, Treatment = Normal) file contains raw
macroinvertebrate density data for 500 possible macroinvertebrate codes for
each taxonomic level (class, order, family, genus). The `occurrences`
function selects the codes that should be used for the `TITAN2::titan` run.
The goal is to select the macroinvertebrate code with the most taxonomic
detail having at least `n` occurrences. Only one macroinvertebrate code will be
associated with the macroinvertebrate counts. For example, if there are at
least `r as.list(args(pTITAN2::occurrences))$n` occurrences at the genus level, the family, order, and class codes
would not be used in the `TITAN2::titan` run.

The names within the data set are expected to have the following structure:

* 8 characters in length
* characters 1 and 2 denote the class
* characters 3 and 4 denote the order
* characters 5 and 6 denote the family
* characters 7 and 8 denote the genus.

If no information at a level exists, use "00" to hold the place. For
example: A code that is 'Bi000000' is the Bivalvia class, while BiVe0000 is
the Bivalvia class, Veneroida order. BiVeSh00 is the Bivalvia class,
Veneroida order, Spheriridae family. BiVeSh01 is a genus within that family.

The first new function provided by pTITAN2 is `occurrences.`  Taking the
taxonomic data as an input, the return of `occurrences` is a data.frame with the
taxon, the class, order, family, and genus split out into individual columns,
and the count of occurrences within the provided taxonomic data set.
`TITAN2::titan` recommends all taxonomic groups have at least five observations
[@baker2010new]. Thus `occurances` returns only taxons with at least `n`
observations, defaulting to `r as.list(args(pTITAN2::occurrences))$n`.  The taxonomic code chosen for analysis should
be at the finest possible resolution.  For example, if a macroinvertebrate
count has at least `r as.list(args(pTITAN2::occurrences))$n` occurrences in a genus code, the family, order, and class
codes associated with these counts should be removed. Further, if there are too
few counts at the genus level, but at least `r as.list(args(pTITAN2::occurrences))$n` counts at the family level- the
family code would be retained and the order and class codes would be removed.

The second new function provided by pTITAN2 is the `permute` function which
provides a list of permuted sets of taxa and environmental gradients.  This
function is used with categorical environmental variables (treatments), such as
Wet/Dry or Urban/Rural.  The function permutes the treatment labels across the
data such that each station has a non-zero probability of being assigned to each
treatment, and the stations are unique within each treatment and replication.
There are some limitation on the permutations generated by `permute`. First, a site
cannot occur in a category more than once within a permutation. Second, the
original sample size distribution is maintained.  These limitations address
potential sample size effects in TITAN, where treatments with low sample sizes
have wide confidence intervals and variable change points compared to treatments
with high sample sizes, and enable comparisons between treatments with different
sample sizes.

For example, assume we have sites A, B, C, D, and E with treatments 1 and 2
(Table \@ref(tab:exampleTreatmentPermutation)).
Let Trt0 denote the initial treatment labels for the sites and Trt1, ...,
Trt4 denote permuted treatment labels.  For sites A and C, each permuted set of
treatment labels consist of one row for label 1 and one row for label 2.  For
sites B, D, and E, the initial observations were for treatments 1, 2, and 2
respectively.  The balance of these labels is maintained across the
permutations.

```{r, include = FALSE}
set.seed(42) # set the random number generator for reproduciblity
eg_permutation <-
  data.table::data.table(site = c("A", "A", "B", "C", "C", "D", "E"),
                         trt0  = c(1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2))
eg_permutation[, site_n := .N, keyby = .(site)]
eg_permutation[site_n >  1, trt1 := sample(trt0), by = .(site)]
eg_permutation[site_n == 1, trt1 := sample(trt0)]

eg_permutation[site_n >  1, trt2 := sample(trt0), by = .(site)]
eg_permutation[site_n == 1, trt2 := sample(trt0)]

eg_permutation[site_n >  1, trt3 := sample(trt0), by = .(site)]
eg_permutation[site_n == 1, trt3 := sample(trt0)]

eg_permutation[site_n >  1, trt4 := sample(trt0), by = .(site)]
eg_permutation[site_n == 1, trt4 := sample(trt0)]

eg_permutation[, site_n := NULL]
```

```{r label = "exampleTreatmentPermutation", echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
knitr::kable(eg_permutation,
             caption = "Example distribution of sites and perutated treatment labels.",
             align = "c")
```

After permutations, clusters can be used for parallel processing of
`TITAN::titan()` calls.  This can be advantageous
as `TITAN::titan()` calls can be time and computationally expensive.  Following
the needed `TITAN::titan()` calls the differences between treatment change
points in the observed data can be compared to the differences between treatment
change points in the permuted stat to determine if the observed treatment
differences are statistically significant.


# Example

Here we present an example showing implementation of pTITAN2.  We will describe
the provided example data sets and how to use the `occurrences()` and
`permute()` functions.

To reproduce the examples in this vignette you will need to load and attach
the pTITAN2 and magrittr namespaces.  Other namespaces are used explicitly,
loaded (not attached) here.

```{r }
library(pTITAN2)
library(magrittr)
loadNamespace("data.table")
loadNamespace("dplyr")
loadNamespace("tidyr")
```

## Example data

Example data provided within the pTITAN2 package were based on publicly
available stream macroinvertebrate data from California.  The data include
existing macroinvertebrate abundances from the California Environmental Data
Exchange Network (CEDEN, last accessed 30 June 2017), and the Southern
California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) [@fetscher2014linking].
Samples in the CEDEN dataset were collected between 2000 and 2016, and samples
from the SCCWRP dataset were collected between 1997 and 2011.  Both data sets
were generated using probabilistic sampling designs and are expected to be
representative of streams in the region.

For this example, data were extracted for California's Chapparal Region
[@ode2011ecological].  Sample observations were divided into one of three
classes based on the precipitation regime for the sampling year using the Palmer
Drought Severity Index (PDSI). The Palmer Drought
Severity Index  was determined for each sampling event using monthly PDSI
data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, last
accessed 21 December 2016) and climate divisions from the National Climatic Data
Center (USGS 2004, last accessed 21 December 2016). All sampling events were
classified as dry (less than -2 PDSI), normal (between -2 and 2 PDSI), or wet (greater than 2 PDSI)
and these classifications were used as treatments for the permutations. The
environmental gradient of interest was percent impervious cover in the upstream
watershed, in this case defined by the National Land Cover Datasets (NLCD,
@homer2007completion, @homer2015completion), with values interpolated between
NLCD years of record (2001,
2006, 2011). Impervious area additions beyond 2011 were estimated as 50% of
disturbed area for construction sites as documented in the California Storm Water
Multiple Application and Report Tracking System (SMARTS dataset, CalEPA)
(smarts.waterboards.ca.gov, last accessed 31 July 2017).

For running pTITAN2, the example data sets have a separate csv or pre-built R
data sets (\@ref(tab:datasets)), for the environmental variable, in this case
percent impervious cover, and macroinvertebrate density data. The data structure
that is shown here is not required for pTITAN2 and instead the environmental
variables and treatments could be in a single data file and subdivided as
desired. Separate data files are provided for each 'treatment' that is explored
including data from either drought (dry) or normal precipitation years in the
Chaparral region of California.

## Function occurrences

The taxonomic sets, CD_06_Mall_wID and CN_06_Mall_wID, contains raw
macroinvertebrate density data for 500 possible macroinvertebrate codes for
each taxonomic level (class, order, family, genus).
```{r}
dim(CD_06_Mall_wID)

# top 4 rows and first 10 columns
CD_06_Mall_wID[1:4, 1:10]
```

The `occurrences`
function selects the codes that should be used for the `TITAN2::titan` run.
The goal is to select the macroinvertebrate code with the most taxonomic
detail having at least `n` occurrences. Only one macroinvertebrate code will be
associated with the macroinvertebrate counts. For example, if there are at
least `r as.list(args(pTITAN2::occurrences))$n` occurrences at the genus level, the family, order, and class codes
would not be used in the `TITAN2::titan` run.

The data is parsed within the `occurrences` call and returns a data.frame with
each taxon code split into its components and the frequency of the taxon within
the data set.
A new function in pTITAN2 is the occurrences function. This is an extension for
deciding the taxonomic detail to be included in a TITAN run based on `minSplt`
in TITAN.  `minSplt` is minimum number of occurrences that TITAN is looking for
taxa to have across the provided sites. The `minSplt` default in TITAN is 5 and
should never drop below 3.  The default for `occurrences` is `minSplt` = `n` =
`r as.list(args(pTITAN2::occurrences))$n`.

```{r label = "occurrences_example"}
head(occurrences(CN_06_Mall_wID[, -1]))
```

Compare these results to working with the raw data.  For example purposes we present the summary of the raw data twice,
once using tidyverse syntax and once using data.table syntax.
```{r}
# Tidyverse
CN_06_Mall_wID %>%
  dplyr::select(-StationID) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = dplyr::everything(), names_to = 'taxon', values_to = 'count') %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
                Class  = substr(.data$taxon, 1L, 2L),
                Order  = substr(.data$taxon, 3L, 4L),
                Family = substr(.data$taxon, 5L, 6L),
                Genus  = substr(.data$taxon, 7L, 8L)
                ) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(.data$Class, .data$Order, .data$Family, .data$Genus) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
                   taxon = unique(.data$taxon),
                   count = sum(.data$count > 0),
                   .groups = "keep"
                   ) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::arrange(.data$Class, .data$Order, .data$Family, .data$Genus)
```

```{r}
# data.table
taxon_count <- data.table::copy(CN_06_Mall_wID)
data.table::setDT(taxon_count)
data.table::set(taxon_count, j = "StationID", value = NULL)
for(j in as.integer(which(sapply(taxon_count, is.integer)))) {
  data.table::set(taxon_count, j = j, value = as.numeric(taxon_count[[j]]))
}

taxon_count <- data.table::melt(taxon_count, variable.factor = FALSE, measure.vars = names(taxon_count), variable.name = "taxon")
taxon_count[, value := sum(value > 0), keyby = .(taxon)]
taxon_count <- unique(taxon_count)

data.table::set(taxon_count, j = "Class",  value = substr(taxon_count[["taxon"]], 1L, 2L))
data.table::set(taxon_count, j = "Order",  value = substr(taxon_count[["taxon"]], 3L, 4L))
data.table::set(taxon_count, j = "Family", value = substr(taxon_count[["taxon"]], 5L, 6L))
data.table::set(taxon_count, j = "Genus",  value = substr(taxon_count[["taxon"]], 7L, 8L))

data.table::setkeyv(taxon_count, c("taxon", "Class", "Order", "Family", "Genus"))

taxon_count[grepl("^(Ar|Bi).+", taxon)]
```

Note that for the Ar class there is only one row with no order, family, or genus
level information.  Compare to the Bi class where the Un order has no presence
counts and is thus not reported in object returned from `occurrences`.  BiVeCa01
has counts and will be reported but BiVeCa00 should not be reported.  BiVe0000
and Bi000000 should not be reported as `occurrences` as preference for the codes
with family and genus level information.

## Function permute

The function permute is used to generate a list of permuted sets of taxa and
environmental gradients. Function parameters include a list of data frames
containing taxa for each treatment group, a list of data frames containing the
associated environmental gradient variables, and the site ids. Before we can run
permute, we need to import the environmental gradients data.

```{r }
eg <-
  permute(taxa = list(CD_06_Mall_wID, CN_06_Mall_wID),
          envs = list(C_IC_D_06_wID, C_IC_N_06_wID),
          sid  = "StationID")
str(eg, max.level = 2)
```

The return of `permute` is list of lists. The first level denotes the treatment,
in this example Treatment1 is "dry" and Treatment2 is "normal" -- the order of
the input data sets.  The second level contains the data.frames with
environmental and taxonomic data.


## Running `TITAN2::titan`

The most computationally expensive part of this work is calling
`TITAN2::titan` many, many times. A good option is to use the parallel
package to send the task of permuting the data and running `TITAN2::titan()`
to individual processing cores.  That is system dependent and left to the end
user to implement.  For an example of generating the permutations with `TITAN2::titan()`
see the example script provided at:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
system.file("example-scripts", "permutation_example.R", package = "pTITAN2")
```
That file will generate the provided data set `permutation_example` with 10 rows
from 10 permutations of the example data set.

```{r}
permutation_example
```

The results are the increasing and decreasing taxa sumz values. In this example only four permutations are
used and TITAN bootstrapping is limited to five iterations. In an actual analysis these values should
be much higher. This process is very computationally intensive and can take hours or days to run
depending on the available computing power and the number of bootstraps and permutations used.

If you have three or more treatments and need to permute over them with the
condition that no station will be in the same treatment more than once on any
particular permutation and that all treatment labels are viable for each
station then you can still use the `permute` function.

## Analyzing the results
The output from the above code chunk can then be used to compare the differences in change-point
values for treatments from the observed samples versus the permuted samples. A p-value test can be
run on these data to test for statistically significant differences between the treatment effects.

```{r, results = "hide"}
# Run TITAN on the observed data
# limited to 2 cores for CRAN policies, end users can use more cores
# the following uses the tidyverse dialect, load and attach the magrittr
# namespace, use dplyr and tidyr namespaces explicitly.

# Conclusions

TITAN is used in ecological studies to determine individual taxa and community
level change points across an environmental gradient for both taxa that increase
with the increasing environmental gradient and taxa that decrease with the
increasing environmental gradient [@baker2010new]. pTITAN2 was developed
as an extension of TITAN to enable comparing TITAN results between different
treatments, including those with variable sample sizes, by permuting the
observed data between the treatments and then rerunning TITAN on the permuted
dataset. This allows for statistically determining difference between the
treatments without using overlapping confidence intervals, which can be
problematic and can lead to accepting the null hypothesis more frequently than
statistically necessary.
